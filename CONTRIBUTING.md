## How to contribute in Hacktoberfest

As you can see our repo has the tag 'hacktoberfest' so any PR merged in our repo will be counted in Hacktoberfest contributions.

First, you can go through the open Issues and comment on them to get assigned for that particular issue.
You will be given 4 days to submit the PR, if you don't send a PR then that issue will be reopened for others to contribute.

If you find any bug in the extension, then you can simply open an Issue, define the bug/problem properly and then proceed to solve it.


## Rules

2. If you have multiple PRs to be merged for the same issue, you have to specify the number of PR in this format: 1/n, 2/n...
3.
